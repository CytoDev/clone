# clone
Bash shell script to clone files or entire blocks to any location.

## How it works
Clone.sh can be renamed to whatever you feel like and dumped where you need it. I placed mine in bin, since I do a lot of file system cloning lately and want quick access to it.

You can use it by calling the script and filling the boxes on screen. You will be prompted to enter the input file/block, output file/block and blocksize. If all is correct the cloning is started and you can sit back and relax.
